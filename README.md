# Sentiment-Analysis
A machine learning model for classifying IMDB reviews as positive or negative. It preprocesses text with tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, then extracts features using TF-IDF. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models are trained and evaluated for accuracy. The system efficiently predicts sentiment for review analysis.
